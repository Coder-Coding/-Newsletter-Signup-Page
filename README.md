# Newsletter Signup Page

## Description

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to sign up for a newsletter by providing their name and email address. The collected data is stored in Mailchimp, a popular email marketing service, for managing and communicating with subscribers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the content of the signup page, including form elements for user input.
- **CSS**: Applies styles to the signup page to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the signup form and handles client-side form submission.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying HTTP request handling and routing.
- **body-parser**: Middleware for Express that parses incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle form data.
- **HTTP Requests**: Used to send user data from the signup form to the Mailchimp API.
- **Mailchimp API**: Integrated to store and manage newsletter subscribers.

## Features

- **Signup Form**: 
  - Users can enter their first name, last name, and email address.
- **Data Handling**:
  - Form data is sent to the server using HTTP POST requests.
  - Server processes the data and communicates with Mailchimp API.
- **Integration with Mailchimp**:
  - Data is added to a specific Mailchimp audience list.
  - Authentication is managed using an API key.
- **User Feedback**:
  - Users receive feedback via success or failure pages based on Mailchimp's response.

## Implementation Details

- **Server-Side Code**:
  - Node.js and Express handle incoming requests and send responses.
  - `body-parser` parses form data from requests.
  - HTTP requests are made to the Mailchimp API to manage subscribers.
- **API Integration**:
  - Mailchimp API integration for adding users to the mailing list.
  - Secure management of API keys.

## Security Considerations

- API keys and other sensitive information are managed securely and excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.
